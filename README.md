Project page of  "IFCNN: A General Image Fusion Framework Based on Convolutional Neural Network,  Information Fusion, Under Revision". 



Highlights :

- Propose a general image fusion framework based on convolutional neural network
- Demonstrate good generalization ability for fusing various types of images
- Perform comparably or even better than other algorithms on four image datasets
- Create a large-scale and diverse multi-focus image dataset for training CNN models
- Incorporate perceptual loss to boost the model’s performance



The structure of our image fusion model is as follows.
